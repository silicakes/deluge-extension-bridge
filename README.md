## Getting Started üöÄ

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser with **WebMIDI support** (like Chrome, Edge, or Opera).
*   Your Synthstrom Deluge connected to your computer or mobile device via **USB**.
*   For mobile use: An Android device with USB OTG support or iOS device (with appropriate adapters).

### Setup

1.  üîå Connect your Deluge to your computer or mobile device via USB.
2.  üìÇ Open [dex.silicak.es](https://dex.silicak.es) in a compatible web browser.
3.  üîê When prompted by the browser, **Allow** MIDI access.
4.  üñ±Ô∏è Select your Deluge from the MIDI **input** and **output** dropdown menus.
    *   ‚ú® **Pro Tip:** If a device named `Deluge Port 3` is found, DEx will try to select it automatically if 'Connect Automatically' is checked!

## How to Use üéõÔ∏è

### Main Controls

*   **Start Display Refresh**: Begins polling the Deluge for display updates (OLED or 7-Segment).
*   **Switch Display Type**: Toggles the view between the OLED and 7-Segment displays.
*   **Get Debug Messages**: Manually requests the latest debug info from the Deluge.
*   **Monitor UI Changes**: Toggles the UI monitoring mode on/off.
*   **Full Screen**: Enters a distraction-free fullscreen mode that optimizes the display for your current device and screen size. Press 'ESC' or tap the button again to exit.
*   **üì∏ Screenshot**: Download a snapshot of the current canvas as a PNG by clicking the camera icon or pressing 's'.
*   **üìã Copy Base64**: Copy the current OLED display as a gzipped, base64-encoded string (in a markdown directive) by clicking the copy icon or pressing 'c'.
*   **‚öôÔ∏è (Gear Icon)**: Opens the Advanced Settings Drawer.

### Advanced Settings Drawer

*   **OLED Display Settings**: Customize pixel size and colors. Click 'Apply Settings' to see changes and save them.
*   **Display Controls**: Manually trigger OLED/7-Segment updates, run a Ping test, or test internal decoding functions.
*   **Deluge Info**: Get Firmware Version and Features Status.
*   **Custom SysEx**: Input field and 'Send' button for arbitrary commands. Clickable examples provided!
*   **Copy Base64**: Use the copy icon or press 'c' to copy the current OLED display as a gzipped, base64-encoded string in a markdown directive (e.g., `::screen[...]{alt="Canvas Image"}`).
*   **Debug Output**: Shows incoming debug messages, version info, etc. Features 'Clear' and 'Auto Debug' buttons.

### Mobile Usage Tips

**  iOS currently doesn't support webMIDI in its common browsers (Safri, Chrome etc..).
Although there are some browsers that were patched support it, I can't recomment any since I don't use iPhone. **

*   For the best experience on mobile devices, use the **Full Screen** button to maximize the display.
*   On Android, you may need a USB OTG (On-The-Go) adapter to connect your Deluge.
    Although for me, it works with a regular USB-C to USB-B cable.
*  
*   Rotate your device to landscape orientation for an optimal viewing experience.
*   Press 'f' on external keyboards or tap the Full Screen button again to exit fullscreen mode.

## Technical Tidbits ü§ì

DEx leverages the **WebMIDI API** to communicate with the Deluge using MIDI System Exclusive (SysEx) messages. It sends commands to request information and receives data back, including display states and debug messages.

*   **Display Rendering**: The OLED display (128√ó48 pixels) data is received in a compressed 7-to-8 bit RLE format. DEx unpacks this efficiently and renders it onto an HTML `<canvas>` element. Delta updates are used for smoother refreshes.
*   **Copy Base64**: The OLED buffer can be copied as a gzipped, base64-encoded string (not a PNG) for sharing or embedding. The output is a markdown directive like `::screen[BASE64]{alt="Canvas Image"}`.
*   **Responsive Design**: The fullscreen mode uses adaptive scaling to provide optimal visibility on displays of all sizes, from mobile phones to large projector screens.
*   **SysEx Format**: Deluge commands generally follow the format `F0 7D [command] [parameters] F7`.
    *   Ping: `F0 7D 00 F7`
    *   Request OLED: `F0 7D 02 00 01 F7`
    *   Request 7-Segment: `F0 7D 02 01 00 F7`
    *   Request Debug: `F0 7D 03 00 01 F7`
    *   Request Features: `F0 7D 03 01 01 F7`
    *   Request Version: `F0 7D 03 02 01 F7`
